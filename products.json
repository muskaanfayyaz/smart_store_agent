    "problem": "i have stomach pain due to periods",
    "product": "For stomach pain during periods, I would suggest **Ibuprofen (like Advil or Motrin)**.",
    "description": "Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are hormones that are produced during menstruation and contribute to inflammation and pain, specifically the cramping associated with periods.  By reducing prostaglandin production, ibuprofen helps alleviate the pain and inflammation in the uterine muscles causing menstrual cramps.  It's widely available, relatively safe when taken as directed, and is effective for many individuals experiencing menstrual cramps.\n\n**Important Note:** This is not medical advice.  Always follow the directions on the label and consult a doctor or pharmacist if symptoms persist, worsen, or if you have any underlying health conditions.  Other pain relievers may be more suitable for some individuals."

    "product": "I cannot provide medical advice.  Vomiting since morning could be caused by many things, some serious.  **The customer should see a doctor or other qualified healthcare professional immediately.**  Self-treating could be dangerous.",
    "description": "While some might suggest an over-the-counter antiemetic like Pepto-Bismol for mild, short-term upset stomachs,  it's crucial to determine the *cause* of the vomiting before recommending any medication.  Prolonged vomiting can lead to dehydration and other complications."

  {
    "problem": "i am feeling dizzy",
    "product": "For dizziness, I would suggest an **over-the-counter antihistamine like Dramamine (dimenhydrinate)**.",
    "description": "Dramamine helps because dizziness can sometimes stem from inner ear problems that affect balance, or from motion sickness (which also impacts balance).  Dimenhydrinate works by blocking the effects of histamine in the brain, which can help to reduce nausea and dizziness associated with these issues.  It's important to note that it's only a temporary solution and if the dizziness persists or worsens,  professional medical advice should be sought."

    "problem": "i have nosea",
    "product": "Product:** Saline nasal spray.",
    "description": "**Why it's helpful:**  A customer saying \"i have nosea\" likely means they have a stuffy or congested nose. Saline nasal spray helps by:\n\n* **Hydrating nasal passages:**  The salt water solution helps to loosen and thin the mucus, making it easier to drain and clear the congestion.\n* **Rinsing irritants:** Saline spray can help wash away allergens, dust, and other irritants that might be contributing to nasal congestion.\n* **Gentle relief:** It's a gentle, non-medicated option suitable for most people, including children and pregnant women (always check the product label).\n\n\nIt's important to note that if the congestion is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms (fever, pain), they should consult a doctor.  Saline spray is a good first step for mild nasal congestion but isn't a cure-all."

    "problem": "i want milk",
    "product": "Product:** Lactaid Milk",
    "description": "**Why it's helpful:**  Many people are lactose intolerant and experience digestive discomfort (bloating, gas, diarrhea) after consuming milk. Lactaid milk contains lactase enzyme, which breaks down the lactose (milk sugar) in the milk, making it easier to digest for those with lactose intolerance.  If the customer is experiencing these symptoms after drinking regular milk, Lactaid provides a solution allowing them to enjoy the taste and nutritional benefits of milk without the negative side effects."
